# 📦 SQL Capstone Project: Customer Churn Analysis

## 🧠 Overview
This SQL-based project analyzes e-commerce customer data to study **churn behavior**. The dataset includes demographics, app usage, payment modes, and other behavior metrics.

## 🗂️ Dataset Schema
The project uses a table called `customer_churn` with fields such as:
- `CustomerID`: Unique customer identifier
- `Churn`: Whether customer churned (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
- `Tenure`, `Gender`, `PreferredLoginDevice`, etc.

## 🧾 File Included
- **My SQL Capstone Project.sql**  
  Contains SQL code for:
  - Creating the database & table
  - Inserting customer data

## 🧪 Key Analysis Goals
- Segment customers based on churn likelihood
- Identify which features (like payment method, device used) influence churn
- Generate insights for customer retention

## 🔧 Tools Used
- **MySQL**
- **SQL Workbench / DBeaver / Any IDE**

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Run the `.sql` file in a SQL IDE (e.g., MySQL Workbench)
2. Query the `customer_churn` table for analysis
3. Build dashboards using BI tools (optional)
